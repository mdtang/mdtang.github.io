                                        <p>In the southern neighborhood of Ann Arbor, an organization called the Community Action Network (CAN) has formed Bryant Community Center into a stable resource and haven for local residents and underprivileged families. Some of those resources include weekly food pantries with fresh meat and vegetables to after-school programs for elementary school kids. Unfortunately, CAN needed a responsible staff member to oversee the center for fellowship and religious meetings that happen on a regular basis. For instance, former alcoholics and drug addicts need a private space to discuss their recovery journey together.</p>

                                        <p>After learning about the service that CAN has committed to for decades, I decided to join as the only weekend staff and administer the center for incoming groups and food clients.

                                        <p>I wanted to understand the effectiveness of Michigan K-8 charter schools, specifically that of the National Heritage Academy (NHA) schools, and the impact (or lack thereof) of their educational policies based on moral character and parental involvement.

                                        <p><b>Process and Solution:</b></p>
                                        <p>I conducted extensive online research gathering and analyzing academic articles, news articles, and other relevant information about NHA schools. Then I created a presentation that outlined my findings. One of my findings was that parents make up the moral focus committee. They bring in speakers for assemblies and activities such as family picnics and recreational events. One school established the Watch DOGS (Dads of Great Students) group to help students without fathers so they can be provided with role models in their lives. Finally, I evaluated and compared quantitative data of the grades, test scores, attendance rates, etc., of Michigan charter school students and public school students through Microsoft Excel.</p>
                                        <p>As I reported my findings regarding the quantitative data, I discovered that while NHA charter schools enforce significantly more parental involvement and a larger focus on academic excellence, public schools sometimes are just as effective in educating students successfully than those charter schools.</p>

                            <p>As a new owner of a small day spa in Downtown Ann Arbor, my client needed help with attracting customers and generating sufficient revenue to make a significant profit. However, she did not speak fluent English and faced difficulty in using technology to post online advertisements and connect with her clients online.</p>

                            <p>I accepted her generous request for me to work as her business development manager and translator. I designed and currently maintain her business' WordPress website to connect with customers. I also distribute ads on online platforms such as Craigslist, create promotional posters and monthly business plans and manage property paperwork. I have doubled revenue for four months and continue to expand the reach of her customer-base across Ann Arbor and surrounding cities.</p>

                            <p><b>Problem:</b></p>
                            <p>My high school is known as one of the best performing arts schools in the city of Philadelphia. However, the school district has not sufficiently funded my school, so teachers were forced to leave and resources were cut by significant margins. An ESL student from China who struggled with the English language barrier and public speaking sought help from teachers. As a temporary solution, the school hired a temporary ESL assistant who was unable to assist him for more than a few hours a week and did not speak his native language.</p>
                            <p><b>Process and Solution:</b></p>
                            <p>As a close friend of his who spoke his native language, I saw the perfect opportunity to tutor and mentor him, which would save the school tens of thousands of dollars and would make it easier for him to seek help for his schoolwork as well as any personal issues he is facing. Therefore, I translated lectures for him, tutored him on grammar, writing, and public speaking skills both in and out of class.</p>
                            <p>After almost four years, he can now speak fluent English and no longer face issues with public speaking.</p>

                            <p>Due to a significant shortage of financial resources, my high school lacked a robust college preparation program for students. I sought to fix that problem.</p>
                            <p><b>Process and Solution:</b></p>
                            <p>I founded a workshop program that prepared eleventh grade students for standardized testing and college applications. I also advanced students’ knowledge on application deadlines and test and essay writing strategies. This program has been continued by current twelfth grade students.</p>
