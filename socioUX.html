        <h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <div>Why do people choose to use certain websites or mobile apps over others?</div>
        <div id="operation" class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <h1>Research Process</h1>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <h4>Operationalization of Concepts</h4>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <div>The two concepts I wanted to define for my research question are:</div>
        <div class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <ul>
          <div class="bold listwrapper">
            <li>1. The reasons users have for using specific websites</li>
            <div class="smallpadding"></div>
            <li>2. Mobile apps and users’ attitudes towards specific websites and mobile apps they have used</li>
          </div>
        </ul>
        <div class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <p>In regard to the first concept, each user would have their own reasons for using certain websites/apps. However, I assumed that there would be unique cases to pinpoint, such as forced circumstances that many users have no control over. I also
          wanted to investigate users’ patterns in their favorite and least favorite websites/apps, since their reasons and motivations would correspond to specific websites/apps. I measured this variable by first asking my respondents’ favorite and least
          favorite websites and mobile applications, then I included open-ended questions regarding any goals and/or motivations they have for using those websites/apps.</p>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>Regarding the second concept, users’ attitudes with website and apps can change as they gain more exposure towards those platforms. Sometimes, a user can achieve a short-term goal with a website/app, such as to alleviate boredom. This means that
          website/app has succeeded in fulfilling user needs. However, he/she may also face difficulties with that website/app, which can negatively impact his/her user experience. Then, they may be less motivated to revisit and reuse that website/app,
          and may want to switch to a different website/app if there are alternatives available. I measured this variable by asking Likert-scale questions regarding respondents’ attitudes of the websites/apps they listed. More specifically, these questions
          asked them to rate those websites/apps on ease of use, quality, and probability of prolonged use.</p>
        <div id="method" class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <h1>Method</h1>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>I conducted an online survey with open-ended and close-ended questions that was open for two weeks using Qualtrics survey software. The survey received 62 total responses with 40 valid responses, while 22 responses were invalid due to too many
          incomplete or skipped responses to essential questions.</p>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>Out of the 38 respondents who answered the question about their age, <span class="bold">the mean age is 22.75 years with a standard deviation of 5.49 years, ranging from 18 years to 50 years</span>. In terms of race and ethnicity, <span class="bold">twenty (52.63%)
          of my respondents are Caucasian and fifteen (39.47%) are Asian/Pacific Islander</span>. Overall, my demographic data support the notion that my main results will only reflect on a subset of the general population since the majority of my respondents
          are from my social circle and/or are in college. Most are in their late teens and twenties, and are primarily Caucasian and Asian. Consequently, my main results will not reveal patterns for older individuals and individuals of ethnicities other
          than Caucasian and Asian.</p>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <div>Here are the screencaps from the survey:</div>

        <h1 id="results">Results</h1>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>From the open-ended responses where respondents were asked to enter their favorite and least favorite websites and mobile apps, I created three categories that these websites/apps in my sample fall into. They are:</p>
        <ul>
          <div class="bold textwrapper">
            <div class="smallpadding"></div>
            <li>Social networking</li>
            <div class="smallpadding"></div>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <div class="smallpadding"></div>
            <li>Productivity</li>
            <div class="smallpadding"></div>
          </div>
        </ul>
        <p>The social networking category is defined as websites and mobile apps that people use to connect with other people through text, photos, videos, and/or other methods.</p>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>The entertainment category is defined as websites and mobile apps that people use to enjoy and relax, instead of to seek information.</p>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>Examples include video games, television shows, movies, etc. Finally, I define the productivity category as websites and mobile apps that people use to seek information in order to complete a daily task.</p>
        <div class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <div>There are a few key findings I want to point out.</div>
        <div class="smallpadding"></div>
        <p>First of all, some respondents indicated that they used certain websites and apps under forced circumstances, rather than under their own decision-making. One respondent said he/she had no choice but to use the <span class="bold">Top Hat Lecture mobile app</span>because
          it was a requirement for one of his/her college courses. The goal of the app is to take class attendance and allow students to view PowerPoint lecture slides. <span class="bold">The respondent was forced to pay for the premium features of the app in order to participate
          in the class, and even after doing so, his/her attendance was sometimes recorded incorrectly</span>. I believe this finding suggests that users use websites or apps not solely based on their needs or those platforms’ designs, but due to unavoidable
          circumstances. People may have no choice but to use a certain website/app while having to pay for it and face its technical issues even after paying.</p>
        <div class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <p>Another key finding pertains to questions asking users about the respondents’ least favorite websites or apps. For example, when asked about the quality of the website/app on a scale from one to five, seven out of 35 respondents (20% - five respondents
          skipped this question) chose the rating of 1, 13 respondents (35.1%) chose the rating of 2, seven respondents (20%) chose the rating of 3, another seven (20%) chose the rating of 4, and one chose the rating of 5. Additionally, ten out of 35
          respondents (28.6%) chose ‘very interested’ or ‘interested’ as their answer when asked whether they are interested in reusing their least favorite website/app. These least favorite websites received surprisingly fewer negative ratings and responses
          than expected. An explanation for this ambivalence is that many websites/apps listed as least favorites are not objectively terrible products, and often appeared as favorites in some respondents’ answers. Examples include Facebook, YouTube,
          and Twitter. My results show that these three websites show up both in the list of favorite websites/apps and in the list of least favorite websites/app. A respondent’s negative experience of a website/app does not equal a negative experience
          for another respondent. <span class="bold">He/she may only dislike one aspect of the website/app that is enough to turn off that user, but it does not mean he/she dislikes it in its entirety. This is especially the case when
          the website/app is consistently used by millions of people that agree on its usefulness.</span></p>
        <div class="mediumpadding"></div>
        <p>Regarding respondents’ overall user experiences with websites/apps, I have noticed that they <span class="bold">expressed a greater degree of disapproval towards mobile apps than web or desktop apps</span>. In fact, it is to the point where no
          mobile app (0%) was specifically listed in the favorites category, while nine mobile apps out of 22 websites and apps (41%) were listed in the least favorites category. Some examples are Spotify, ESPN, or Steam, where respondents listed their
          web or desktop versions as their favorite, but their mobile app counterparts appear as least favorites. These results suggest that <span class="bold">users generally have better user experiences and face fewer problems using the desktop versions of websites/apps
          compared to mobile versions. Mobile apps may also be more difficult to design compared to desktop apps due to constraints such as the limited processing capabilities of a smartphone</span>.</p>
